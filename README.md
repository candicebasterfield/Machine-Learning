Classification task 

Beta Bank is experiencing a gradual customer attrition, with clients leaving the bank every month. To address this, the bank wants to retain existing customers, as it is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to leave in the near future, which would enable the bank to take proactive retention measures.

Using historical data on customer behavior and contract terminations, I will train a model to maximize the F1 score, focusing on balancing precision and recall. To meet the project requirements, the model must achieve an F1 score of at least 0.59 on the test set. I will also calculate the AUC-ROC metric to assess model performance, comparing it with the F1 score to ensure the model effectively distinguishes between those likely to stay and those at risk of leaving.
